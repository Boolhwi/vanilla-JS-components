# vanilla-JS-components
Not using js libaray ( react, vue, angular ) I try making each component in one js file. This file also include css style.   
There are 'modal', 'drop-down', 'drag-and-drop', 'sidebar', 'carousel', 'tooltip', 'accordion', 'tabs' components.   
After finising this project, I could recognize the needs of js libaray.
